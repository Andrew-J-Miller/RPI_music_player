# RPI_music_player

RPI_music_player contains music script.py, a python script designed to play a designated song on a Raspberry pi based on the state of 3 GPIO pins.

This script is part of a circuits project where each GPIO pin will be assigned to the ouput of a high order butterworth filter circuit that has been converted to a flat DC voltage and regulated to 5 volts, so as to not overload the maximum power ratings of the Raspberry pi.
